Resolving Differences
=====================

*Note: “Butter-ball Charm” refers not to any modern American trademark,
but to Krishna’s Butter Ball in Mahabalipuram, India. It is near
Chennai, and quite interesting.*

Cappadocia was not a very peaceful country. Three times in the last
twenty years, it had gone to war with one of its neighbors, the island
of Cyprus. This was something of which Hermione was acutely aware, since
the last war had only been two years ago, and British witches and
wizards felt an extremely strong bond with the Cypriots. The *Daily
Prophet* had run stories about the sufferings of the beleaguered
Cypriots, and the treacherous dealings of the Cappadocians. It was all
very suspicious, since tiny Magical Cyprus mostly spoke English and was
dominated by several wealthy and influential wizarding families, while
sprawling Magical Cappadocia had few cultural bonds with Britain and
considerably less money. Barbarians versus the elite made for good copy.
Harry controlled *The Prophet*, she knew, so it was odd the paper had
been so uncritical. She supposed he didn’t micromanage.

Actually, Hermione considered, since most Cappadocians spoke Greek as
well as Arabic, they couldn’t really be said to be “<span lang=el>βάρβαρος</span>.” That
nasty term had been used by ancient Greeks to describe those who
*couldn’t* speak Greek. It was onomatopoeia for what the Greeks had
thought foreigners sounded like: bar-bar-bar-bar. Maybe she should write
a pseudonymous letter to the editor, pointing this out, the next time
the country hit the headlines.

Hermione gripped her broom tighter, increased her speed, and glanced
around at the warband. Simon and Charlevoix were flying next to her,
while Esther and Susan were below. Just above and behind her, Hyori and
Jessie rode their own brooms, faces tight. She might need to write the
letter soon. Somehow she thought Cappadocia would be in the news very
shortly.

She looked down at the ground racing by below. Stone pillars sprouted
up from the windswept rock below — the fairy chimneys. Tall and smooth,
they studded the ridges and plateaus, looking for all the world like the
frozen fingers of some trapped race of giants. They were natural
formations — not ventiform, as the wind-whipped dust that swept past
them might suggest, but worn away by years of cracking frost and
whittling rain. Hermione looked away from them, leaned forward, and
squinted ahead. Those white hills, there… yes. They were close. She
raised her right hand and gave the high sign, and Hyori and Jessie
peeled away from the group, swooping along a different path.

The fortress of Göreme, situated near the Turkish town of the same
name, was protected in three ways.

First and most importantly, Göreme’s existence was a secret. The best
way to protect anything was to make sure that no one knows it exists. If
you are unscrupulous and willing to use Obliviate, you could keep
something very secret indeed.

Second, Göreme was inaccessible. It had its beginnings in a cave
complex used as a Christian church during the eleventh century. The
church remained, though it was now known as the Limon Kilise — to
describe the sour feeling in the belly one experienced when visiting.
The long and narrow passage through to the larger set of natural caves,
on the other hand, had been erased by the Butter-ball Charm (which
turned stone as soft as butter). Göreme was now surrounded by solid
rock, and the depths of the fortress reached two hundred meters beneath
the dust of the surface.

Third, Göreme was guarded by an army. The Exarchate of Cappadocia
(which had no place in Muggle history, however important it might be to
the course of magical events) did not station pairs of aurors or teams
of Hit Wizards. Göreme was military, and its Dementors were weapons, and
its guards were soldiers.

Cappadocia was not unique in the wizarding world for possessing a
specialized army rather than relying on policing forces or militia.
While the Peace of Westphalia had established the idea of an explicit
“magical state,” and the establishment of the International
Confederation of Wizards pushed these states into formal organization,
numerous personal fiefdoms persisted well past the end of the nineteenth
century. It is true that political pressures, like the International
Statute of Secrecy, and social pressures, like increasing education and
Quidditch, did much to consolidate these pockets of autocracy into the
same oligarchies that ruled much of the world. But nonetheless, some
modern oligarchies and all modern autocracies had standing armies.

Truth be told, it would be difficult to say whether the Exarchate of
Cappadocia was dominated by the sitting Strategos, or if the wealthy
*sakellarioi* simply established new figureheads at regular intervals.
Either way, it didn’t matter to Hermione. Political reform of this
(literally) byzantine country was secondary to another concern: the
Cappadocians had Dementors, and they fed prisoners to those Dementors to
keep them manageable. And that was not acceptable.

Hermione pulled up on her broom, slowing down, and the rest of the
group matched her deceleration. She came to a stop, and pointed one
finger at an uneven plateau of rock, far below them. “There. Bubble up,
everyone. *Bullesco*.” The Bubble-Head Charm sprouted from one nostril
in its disturbing way, a single small translucent bubble swelling in the
span of a breath until it encompassed her entire head. It wobbled a bit
before settling into place. The other four witches and wizards did the
same, ensuring they would have a supply of fresh and dust-free air.

Alarms would be going off in Göreme about now. She didn’t know exactly
what their response protocols were, but they had an immense number of
jinxes overlaid on the area. No Apparating, no Time-Turners. There was
an Anti-Disillusionment Charm (a term which gave her linguistic
heartburn). Further, there was a charm to prevent broomstick
enchantments from functioning. It didn’t extend to this height, so as
not to betray their position to a chance passerby or intruding Cypriot,
but all of these jinxes limited their ability to respond. They could
certainly be turned off, but what use was a precaution if you dropped it
at every moment of alarm?

It was difficult to guess what they must be doing down there, deep
underground, glued to their Foe-glasses. They had probably sent for aid.
Were they confident that they were safe, unreachable down under all that
stone? *Diffindo* did a great deal of damage to rock, but it would take
long minutes for such a small attack force to blast their way down.

They didn’t know enough to be afraid of 9.8 meters per second per
second.

Hermione reached into the pouch at her waist and groped around for a
second. She felt her nails scratch into something, and hoped she hadn’t
just damaged something important. It was one of the most annoying things
about alicorn fingernails… even if she kept them nightmarishly short,
they could still accidentally scratch things if she wasn’t careful.
Super-strength and claws might sound cool, but fingernails were
definitely not designed to work like an animal’s talons. It was
embarrassing to accidentally ruin furniture, and it was annoying to pick
the resulting detritus of stone, metal, or wood from where it would get
embedded.

When she found the sextant, she lifted it to her eye and sighted
through the eyepiece. The bubble around her head jiggled under the
pressure as it warped. She found the horizon and adjusted the
declination of the index, clicking it along to the proper minute and
second. She checked the measurement, then checked her watch, and lastly
checked that she was directly over the big white rock. Then she clicked
her wand right next to the aeronautical sextant’s index bar, and said,
quietly and repeatedly, “*Finite. Finite. Finite. Finite. Finite.
Finite. Finite. Finite. Finite.*” She paused, then cast the spell ten
more times for good measure. Her targets were enormously large, but also
rather far away. She’d probably missed with most of those — no reason
not to be sure, since the spell took so little effort. She was canceling
her own magic, and so she cast the easiest and least powerful version of
the spell and needed to put very little of herself into each iteration.

There was a long pause before the first beam of depleted uranium hit
the rock beneath them.

Hermione could feel the impact in her inner ear as the roar of sound
and air and dust blasted into the five mounted witches and wizard. They
were quite high up… but then, it was quite an impact. Harry had told her
about the idea, gifted to him by science fiction (*The Moon Is a Harsh
Mistress, *by Robert Heinlein, her brain automatically supplied). Set
high enough, the impact could have had the force of a nuclear weapon.
But that would have required Muggle technology, which didn’t work in the
presence of magic (and it would have been overkill).

The whole thing was complicated enough. It had initially proven
impossible, no matter how exact they were and how many calculations they
did, to actually hit the beams with a *Finite* to end their Hover
Charms. They’d tried attaching huge sheets to the beams to act as bigger
targets, but they’d only acted as parachutes to drag the beams away from
the necessary spot. The only way Harry and she could get it to work,
after much experimentation, was to glue long threads of transfigured
Teflon to their transfigured beams. The many threads were insubstantial
yet easy to hit.

After the first beam hammered into the stone — once they knew it was
working, but before the next ones struck with their own blasts of sand
and dust — Hermione and her Returned clumped together and Susan cast a
*Prismatic Shield*. They watched the next four beams hit in close
succession. One was badly off target, but as far as she could see, it
had missed to the north, rather than to the south. Hermione was willing
to destroy the Limon Kalise if she had to, but she’d rather preserve it.
It was an excellent representation of Byzantine Christian architecture
and art.

The best Muggle bombs couldn’t penetrate much deeper than sixty meters
or so, even the ones currently under development, Harry had said. Well,
nuclear bombs could do better, but that was out of the question. It
didn’t matter, anyway. They didn’t want to penetrate and murder
everyone.

They weren’t trying to crush the wasp’s nest. They were trying to shake
it up enough so that all the wasps came out to play.

Metal fell from the sky like the wrath of an angry deity. Each
concussion had reached them even beyond the *Shield*. Göreme was no
hardened facility, like the Muggle military bunkers Harry had discussed
with her with such pleasure. There was no anchoring or precautions taken
against impact. It was essentially just a set of buildings constructed
into natural caves. It would be very susceptible to some vigorous
shaking.

They waited a few minutes, remaining still and in place. After a while,
a green bolt of light streaked out of the rock below. It went the wrong
way and vanished into the sky, nowhere near Hermione or her Returned. It
had been shot blindly. A clever idea in its essence, undertaken by some
desperate and vicious soldier, but the odds of a blindly-aimed curse
hitting them were microscopic. She noted the trick down in her memory
for later consideration.

Figures appeared on the ground below. Twenty or thirty, perhaps. The
witches and wizards inside were using their portkeys to get outside to
face the attackers who had just rattled them with a half-dozen serious
earthquakes. An instant later, curses began pouring up and at Hermione
and her tightly-packed crowd of convenient targets. Susan dropped her
*Shield* without needing to be told, and they all separated and began
dodging.

Hermione had thought that the soldiers would be coming on brooms, but
they didn’t seem to have disengaged that jinx. Odd... that left them as
distant infantry fighting an air attack. Perhaps they didn’t feel
threatened, since the Returned were high enough that neither side could
really effectively aim? No, that didn’t seem credible… they’d just had
their secret military base smashed by mysterious metal rods from the
sky. They would definitely be feeling threatened.

Hm, a powerful attack or jinx that they were readying? Or were they
just too rattled to get their act together?

She shrugged, and gave the high sign again. The Returned began reaching
into their own pouches, scooping out pots, and dropping pot after pot.
The pots were padded or altered in all manner of ways, the legacy of a
school project that both Hermione and Harry had done when they were ten
(”Class, we are going to be trying to figure out how we might drop an
egg from the roof without the egg breaking. Please look at the first
page of your worksheet packet…”) There were some with small parachutes,
some with inflated bladders, some with thick padding, and many others.

To be honest, it probably would have been better to actually test these
first, and see which ones worked the best. Then they could have copied
those. But this way had been much more fun. When Hermione had gone to
Tesco for crafting supplies, Harry had given her a list as long as his
arm, and she was fairly sure he’d spent all night on his six designs.

Esther, on the other hand, had looked at them as if they were crazy and
had just cast a Charm. She’d been done with her six pots in sixty
seconds. Philistine.

Many of the pots smashed with great force onto the rock, seeming like
some direct and pathetic bombardment. One landed directly on a wizard,
but exploded into flinders and dust when it hit an active shield. A few
others landed with such ease and grace that she bet they weren’t even
cracked, and so they had no effect.

Others, though, were simply smashed open. And the young Mandrakes that
were awoken from their warm and comfortable napping in the dirt wailed
in protest.

It was a common Muggleborn trick, she had to admit. People who entered
the magical world after growing up in the more safety-conscious mundane
life of Muggles were frequently astonished that there were so many
dangerous spells, plants, and creatures, much in the way that few
pureblood witches and wizards who’d seen the accident statistics could
understand the use of automobiles. To the Muggleborn, it was immediately
obvious that these deadly things could be used directly as weapons.

She’d read a dozen books about why this was a foolish idea. In the
first place, the scream is easily warded by an adult witch or wizard.
Further, they only scream when awoken, so you must awkwardly go to
battle with a fairly obvious large container, making surprise difficult
to achieve. Even further, Mandrakes take most of a year to fully mature.
Until then, their scream will merely cause unconsciousness. There were
many other spells that could be cast that did not require most of a year
of preparation and a large flowerpot, and which could not be blocked by
numerous trivial charms. The plant had its uses, but the practical ones
were almost universally as a potion ingredient.

Mandrakes and chainsaws made poor weapons, and for much the same
reasons.

All of those caveats were true, and all of those scolding books were
wise. But if you wished to attack from beyond wand distance,
unexpectedly, and with the intention to stun?

Bombs away.

Hermione had no intention of making this a fair fight. As long as you
controlled the battlefield, you controlled combat, and she’d come
prepared for an aerial war. They had tricks upon tricks upon tricks.
There were a thousand different clever things one could do quite beyond
normal magical dogfighting. If she could eliminate most of the enemy
like this, before they’d even had a chance to take to the air, then this
fight would be short and safe.

They’d run out of Mandrakes. Hermione peered down, squinting. From this
vantage point, it was hard to tell, but only ten or eleven soldiers
still seemed to be moving. It was time for

falling

It was time for falling, apparently. Hermione’s broom went dead as a
stone between her legs. Ah, she mused, letting it tumble away from her
fingers. That’s why they didn’t turn off the jinx. They were just
working on making it stronger. Clever defense, she didn’t know you could
do that. Two overlapping fields, perhaps, with one usually off? The wind
whipped her robes against her face as she fell. How long? Seconds.

Hermione reached to her wrist and slapped a bracelet there, hard. Never
fight in the air without a backup.

Hm. Beater Bastion not working. She slapped it again.

It was a safety device meant for Quidditch, and it was supposed to be
reliable, but she couldn’t help but notice that she was still
plummeting.

She twisted in the air, scrambling for her wand and looking for one of
the Returned. There was no one… getting closer to the ground now… a few
seconds… no, there, Simon, if she could just... no, damn, where’d he go…
there was Esther but Stunned, no no… have to move, can you swim through
the air?... turn turn turn, there he is there wand up and YES *”Arresto
Momentum!”*

He vanished from her sight, jerked away as his descent rapidly slowed.

And that was the last thought Hermione had for some indeterminate
amount of time.
<div>

****************


She could see. Her eyes had already been open, so she hadn’t needed to
do that. But she could see. They must have just healed. She felt
nothing. That would be her spine, broken. Lucky, lucky. This would be
much more unpleasant, otherwise.

Not sure how long she’d been out. A minute or two, probably. She’d
fallen quite far, but wizards were resistant to blunt trauma generally -
some quirk of magical inheritance. Also, Hermione was a troll/unicorn
woman, and rather hard to hurt.

Hermione couldn’t stop herself from blinking the blood out of her eyes,
but remained still otherwise. She couldn’t see anything. Unluckily, her
face was pressed against a large rock, and it entirely blotted out her
view. She listened, instead, and waited for her body to finish healing.

“<span lang=el>Τι συνέβη</span> [What happened]?” A male voice shouted. A female voice
called back an answer, but was too far away to be audible. No mandrakes
could be heard, so the soldiers must have killed the exposed ones.

She heard a slight crackle as her neck healed, the bones pushing
themselves to where they were supposed to be, and drew her breath
sharply as the pain of her body screamed through her. An inarticulate
shout tore from one of the soldiers nearby — so she’d been seen. Well,
nothing for it, then.

Hermione jerked one leg in front of her and pressed against it,
spinning herself into a sidelong roll. There was a wash of heat along
her back as she did — a missed curse. Nausea assaulted her with the
motion, but she ignored it. Her leg wheeled over her spinning body and
impacted the rock, and she levered herself up onto it. The spin
improbably became a vault, and she landed on her feet in a crouch. It
was an act of fluid beauty, and it still seemed unreal that she was
capable of such effortless grace.

Fourteen men and women in Cappadocian robes (sharply pointed sleeves,
swooping long break in the fabric in the back) stood before her, their
attacks halted for the moment now that she was motionless. She’d counted
badly, or they’d already restored several of their number. She only saw
one of her Returned: Simon. He stood nearby, arms raised. She’d saved
him, but all of his emotion was concentrated in anger: the fleshy Scot
was scowling at the soldiers. He’d been disarmed. That was smart. But
neither she nor he had been Stunned. That was foolish.

The other Returned were not visible. They had probably hit the ground
hard, and their emergency portkeys had broken with the impact.

Her own wand was probably somewhere around here. No matter. The
soldiers were watching her warily. They were surprised but not awed, so
maybe the fall hadn’t looked as impressive as it had felt. Still, she
gave it a try, speaking in clear and awkward syllables: “<span lang=el>Θα πρέπει να
παραδοθούν.</span> [You must surrender.]”

There was an absolute and complete absence of contemptuous laughter,
scornful retorts, or other displays of bravado. Instead, several of the
soldiers glanced at one of the tallest among them. Considering the
offer? There were no marks of rank visible, and Hermione surmised that
this man, who was watching her edgily, was some sort of unofficial
leader among the group. He had an impressive chin — broad and cleft.
Could a fantastic chin make you a leader among men?

Whatever thought process had gone on in the man’s mind did not end in
Hermione’s favor. She could see it in his eyes, once he’d decided. It
was disappointing. They must know her — some of them had even probably
seen her in the flesh before, since she’d visited Cappadocia a dozen or
more times — but she and Simon were disarmed and Hermione was a bloody
wreck. Hermione thought she must not be impressive enough. She’d better
work on her image some more. The more fights she could win without
actually fighting, the better. It would make eliminating all the
Dementors that much faster.

The man aimed his wand at her again and shifted his feet. Other
soldiers picked up on the same cue as Hermione, but as they all made
ready to fire, she already was diving to the side and plunging her hand
into her pouch. Curses flicked over her and behind her as soldiers
barked their spells. One curse — a Severing Charm, maybe? — opened up
her back as it struck her squarely. She didn’t know how badly — she was
already on her feet, dodging and flinging a glass orb the size of her
fist at the soldiers.

Big-Chin was a quick thinker, and his wand flicked to the side to track
the orb as it flew at them. “*Reducto*!”

The orb shattered well before it reached them, the glass (actually a
perfectly and wondrously thick hollow borosilicate glass sphere,
courtesy of transfiguration) detonating as its pressures were released.
Big-Chin and another soldier, the closest, were staggered by the
explosion and the wash of warm air that swept over them all. Simon,
unarmed, had dared only cover his face with his hands. He’d known what
to expect, and took advantage of the distraction to immediately slap the
small of his back with one palm. He disappeared with a wet sucking sound
as his portkey was broken and activated.

Hermione dropped to a crouch as the soldiers opened fire again. She
rammed her right hand into her left forearm, below the wrist. Curses
flickered overhead with coruscating light. One brushed her leg, and she
lost feeling in it. Even as she went sprawling, though, she was already
ripping a slender and gorey wand from her left arm, and casting another
Finite with bloodslick fingers. She didn’t have to aim the spell. The
air in the sphere had been quite concentrated.

If she’d been evil, she would have transfigured acid, though it would
have been trickier with the pressure pump and chamber they’d used. This
was just water. Water, water, everywhere. In a drizzlingly thick cloud
around them, in their mouths (tasting of dust), and in their lungs. Even
worse, they’d all taken a few panting breaths over the last ten seconds
or so, respiring transfigured air from what must have seemed like a
small bomb.

In the lungs of Hermione and fourteen other witches and wizards, the
alveoli which clustered like grapes along the bronchioles had
transferred oxygen into their blood and bound it into red blood cells
which raced down capillaries and arteries. The oxygen was immediately
put to work throughout the body in every living cell, producing ATP in a
trillion mitochondria all throughout their flesh.

In an instant, though, a significant percentage of that oxygen had just
been reverted back into water.

And that was the last thought Hermione had for some indeterminate
amount of time.

********************


She could feel. She was on her hands and knees, her fingers buried in
the rock in front of her. She was blind and deaf. But she was alive and
conscious.

Hermione rested for a moment in the sudden peace of deafness, then
pushed back onto her heels and rose to her feet. It was not difficult;
this one hadn’t even hurt. Some percentage of the cells in her body had
just died. The exact number was hard to even guess, but she didn’t
imagine it could have been much. Half a percent?

As her vision slowly returned, along with her hearing (for now, mostly
a high-pitched whine inside her head), she revised her estimate. All
fourteen of her opponents were either writhing in gasping agony... or
lying still and grey.

Wasting no time, though she was a bit unsteady on her feet, Hermione
plucked yet another object from the Pouch of Poorly-Conceived Weapons
Intended for Bombardment. She trotted quickly from body to body with the
device, which was a potent relic from ancient and bygone days: a chrome
money-changer. It had once dispensed coins for a train conductor.

At each body, she clicked the changer over them. A coin dropped onto
them, and they vanished with a wet sucking sound. Off to be saved, off
to the Tower, off to the only man in the world who could heal these
injuries.

The changer made a wonderfully satisfying sound each time, though she
didn’t dawdle to enjoy. *Ker-chak. Ker-chak. Ker-chak. Ker-chak.*

Along the way, she found her regular wand and put it back in its
holster. The still-bloody Ultimate Ulna (she was proud of the name) went
into her pouch.

When she finished, she stopped and looked around. Hermione was alone on
what had once been a rocky plateau but which was now a shattered
moonscape. They might actually have cracked Göreme open, from the look
of the mighty crevasses that still smoked from the impact. Her robes
were ragged and burned and slashed, even soaked through with blood in
many places. Her wounds were gone: in just the past few minutes
shattered bones had pulled together, a deeply slashed back injury had
knit closed, and billions of detonating cells had been transfigured back
into life. No Dementors, though. There must be more soldiers, holding
them in their pen. The pen where they were fed.

This had been poorly planned. She knew better, too. When you are making
a plan, look at each step, and ask yourself: how can this go wrong? Once
you have done that, and satisfied yourself with the answer in each
respect, ask yourself a second question: what two things can go wrong at
the same time? Always plan for two independent failures.

She’d planned for the bombardment to fail, or how to handle a
broomstick failure, or if the enemy found a way to target them in the
air, and everything else. But it hadn’t been enough. All of the first
line of her warband had been taken out in the first engagement (though
they had come to no permanent harm) because the broomsticks had failed
and their safety net had failed. Not paranoid enough, she murmured to
herself with annoyance. Alastor will be disappointed.

Hermione plucked her wand from its holster, and readied herself. Then
she expected the Dementors to come to her. It took no effort, for it
seemed the natural course of events. *I am here. I am waiting.*

*Come and get me.*

Before her, two score of black and indistinct shapes emerged slowly
through the blasted stone. They were hungry and evil and wrong, these
wounds in the world clad in ragged cloaks. They were her great enemy,
and there was nowhere in the world that they could hide from her. She
would hunt them all down, unless they took her now. Hermione willed that
thought out at them like a weapon, and if someone had been watching at
that time, such as Hyori and Jessie (who flew in a wide circle out of
range of the fortress, waiting for green sparks to summon them), that
person would have seen a fierce joy in Hermione’s eyes. She had died
twice in these past eight years, and she had made death her dearest
foe.

She raised her wand, and opened her mouth to cast.

And then her world was flame.

She wasn’t sure what had happened. In some conscious part of her mind,
she knew that the soldiers who had been guarding the Dementors down in
Göreme must have portkeyed to the surface once their charges had
escaped, and that they had turned some spell of fire upon her. But that
thought was beyond her at the moment, because there was fire hot on her
face and burning her burning her. Fire, that could hurt her quickly
enough to incapacitate her. Fire, which had killed her once already. She
shrieked as her flesh seared.

The Dementors were already there, and she felt their presence like a
stain of hate that saturated her, even as the fire roared around her and
devoured her. They were close enough and numerous enough that their
presence began to consume her. The touch of their evil felt like
despair, and it whispered into her mind and it sucked away at her
marrow.

Hermione fell to her knees, and knew dimly that she was dying once
more. The thought beat down on her as though it had great black wings,
pulsing down and driving her to the ground.

She would burn and she would die.

She would burn and she would die.

She would burn and she would die.

But

But there were things to be done.

She was on fire and Dementors were eating her and the soldiers would
kill her *but there were things to be done*.

Hermione rose to her feet, staggering. She shrugged off the hatred that
sucked at her soul with a sheer effort of will. She *defied it,* and
gasped something through a burning throat, and then raised her wand once
more and shouted her spell past pain and smoke. Her voice was inhumanly
powerful, alight with passion and flame.

***”Expecto Patronum!”***

Heat swirled around her, crackling in her hair and turning her robes to
ash around her. She ignored the flames, though the skin on her neck and
arms reddened, cracked, and charred. She ignored the soldiers who poured
fire on her. Her world was her wand and her spell.

And so it was that Cappadocia came to know why she was called the
Goddess.

For the white light that came from her wand was no white mist and no
argent animal. It was not even the shape of a silver human being, though
none of the witnesses would have expected that.

Hermione’s patronus was the noonday roar of the full sun. It was bright
beyond measure and glorious beyond words. With its puissance, she was
ineluctable and divine.

Barely visible through the squinting eyes of the onlookers, forty
Dementors shuddered in place.

Their substance ruffled as though in a strong wind, their black cloaks
billowed back into shreds and threads, and they and their despair ceased
to exist like a candle had been snuffed.

Hermione lowered her wand.

The flames died away, though her robes hung in smoldering and ashy rags
around her. Her body was a mass of pain, but that was temporary, and was
already beginning to fade. It slid away from her awareness more slowly
than before, but the charred flesh was bubbling back into skin and
replacing itself. She plucked at a locket around her neck to free the
chain, so that the piece of gold-and-green jewelry wouldn’t stick
uncomfortably inside the healing wound. Then she raised her wand to send
up red sparks — there were prisoners to rescue — and turned around with
a searching glance. Who had been burning her?

Ah, over there. That had been the trouble. She saw two Cappadocian
soldiers, collapsed and motionless. They’d been badly burned, as well,
but had lacked her advantages. It was a dangerous spell, the sort you’d
normally bring to bear on an army of Inferi rather than one lone woman.

Hermione Jean Granger, the Goddess and the sworn enemy of death, sighed
to herself, pulled a chrome coin changer from the pouch on her belt, and
started saving lives.

******************


Deep in Whitehall lies the Ministry of Magic, from which every aspect
of magical Britain’s government and bureaucracies are officially run.
Deep in the Ministry of Magic lies the Department of Mysteries, where
magical research is conducted and the most esoteric problems are
investigated. And deep in the Department of Mysteries lies the Hall of
Science, in an immense chamber that once held the collected prophecies
of the nation.

In the Hall of Science, five witches and wizards huddled around a
magnificently long hickory table. Mafalda Hopkirk, Dolores Umbridge,
Luna Lovegood, Basil Horton, and Nemeniah Salieri thought they had just
made a great discovery.

They verified their preliminary result. Horton, a sturdy-looking older
wizard with the physique of an athlete gone to fat, raised his wand and
cast, slowly. “*Lumooos. Lumoos. Lumis. Lums. Luums. Lumos. Lumoos.
Lumis. Lumos. Lumos.”*

The spell, cast with the worst imaginable skill, only took on the tenth
try. Horton’s pronunciation only vaguely approximated the necessary
syllables and his wandwork was abysmal: when he had performed the very
slight and simple dip of the wand necessary for the spell, he had
waggled his wand as though palsied. It would have been embarrassing, had
it not been intentional.

The spell was one of the weakest known. When cast this badly, it
yielded a barely visible soft yellow glow. It was an extraordinarily
slight bit of magic.

Horton held his wand next to a thin golden rod. The half-meter rod was
mounted to a bulbous and unworked lump of obsidian. It had been sunk
deep into the crusted grey rock-rime on the lump’s top. The rod vibrated
in place, gently, as the wand approached.

Lovegood and Umbridge looked at each other. Umbridge’s lips were
pursed. She did not entirely approve of these experiments into the
workings behind the Trace, the charm that detected underage magic. But
there were interesting possibilities for control here. She nodded
shortly to Lovegood, and the two of them stepped to the other end of the
table and picked up a grey metal lattice thickly interwoven with green
vines. There were no roots to the vines, only many tiny leaves.

In unison, Lovegood and Umbridge set the lattice over the rod-and-stone
device. Horton did not alter the exceedingly soft glow of his spell, yet
the rod stopped vibrating. Everyone involved looked at each other in
satisfaction, although perhaps only Luna Lovegood truly understood the
importance of what they had discovered.
