Frontloading Mysteries
======================

Ninety percent of everything was terrible. This was also true for
people: ninety percent of them were dumb.

Reg Hig contemplated this unhappy fact as he stared at a copy of the
*Daily Prophet*. The headline read, UNITY APPROACHES. Underneath, a
smiling duo of clear importance were dipping their heads in identical
bows before a dozen witches and wizards in trailing robes. The Tower and
the Goddess, adding another country to their growing global hegemony.

It was tempting to crumple the paper in one angry fist, or perhaps to
burn it into theatrical ashes. But he intended to scrutinize the lead
story carefully, and he was certainly not going to buy a second copy of
this propaganda sheet. The *Daily Prophet* had been a mouthpiece of the
British ruling class since the time of his grandfather, and it was no
different these days, now that a new Dark Lord and Lady had taken
control.

It was almost comical the way each new Dark Lord followed the same
playbook. The first step was to eliminate the main opposition, through
assassination or spellcraft. The second step was to stack the local
Thing (in Britain, it was the Wizengamot) with their followers. The
third step was to take control of the leading newspaper. And last of
all, almost as an afterthought, they would take over the local Ministry
of Magic.

Still, Reg thought, it certainly made sense to use a tried-and-true
method. History showed the wisdom. At the height of the Reign of the
Eleusinian Mysteries, Sulla the Fortunate marched on Rome and took power
by force, wresting it from the Optimates in the name of the Muggle
masses. He ruled with absolute power. Forty years later, a successor did
the same thing, championing the Muggle cause in the Senate and seizing
power by force. Twenty years after that… well, you get the picture.

All else equal, a winning move would stay a winning move… until and
unless you changed the rules. That’s why the third successor of Sulla
the Fortunate had quietly murdered all of his opposition, and had
launched centuries of tyranny. Augustus Caesar had decided to change the
rules, and he had done so with admirable effectiveness.


************

Reg stood from his desk chair, walking to the fireplace. He stamped his
foot on a bright-green bellows at the fireplace entrance, barely
breaking stride as he stepped into the flare of green flame and said,
“Westphalian Council.”

There was a brief moment as he walked from the travel room into the
council chamber itself. For obvious reasons of security, the Floo
network was not connected directly to a place of such power and
discretion as the Westphalian Council’s meeting chamber, or with the
offices of any of the councilors.

Walking into the chamber, through a shower of Thieves’ Downfall, Reg
saw that there was only one other councilor present, sitting behind one
of the tiny desks. Limpel Tineagar was a gangly woman, and she always
looked a trifle silly folded up on the little chairs of the meeting
chamber. As she leaned forward to peer at a parchment, her limbs seem to
be too long and thin. Limpel resembled nothing so much as a robed
spider.

“Reg,” she said warmly, “how are you this morning?”

“Very well,” he replied, walking down the tiers until he was on the
level below her. He was almost a foot shorter than her, and if he had
tried to take advantage of a rare opportunity to loom over someone by
standing next to her, it would have seemed ridiculous to them both.
Power should not be obvious.

“I assume you’ve heard of the French capitulation?” she asked, her tone
less cheerful. “The cowards fall, one by one.”

“That is why I am here,” he said. “We must call a meeting, and we must
discuss what the Americas will do. Inaction is no longer an option — not
with Thing after Thing formally agreeing to the darkest of rituals! If
we wait much longer, then it will be too late.”

“A preview of your speech?” Limpel asked, her mouth twisting with
amusement. She was a cynic, and had no native passion in her. “You rouse
me with your stirring words.”

Reg frowned slightly, and leaned forward, putting his hands on her desk
and looking at her with frank directness. He was not an intimidating
man, he knew. Short and ill-favored, he had a broad face with a plum
nose and dark eyes. The dense black stubble around his mouth was
irregular and resistant to every razor and charm. He was not charismatic
and he was not scary.

But he was very persuasive.

“It’s no joke, Limpel. Blocking the international statute only delayed
Britain for a few years. Europe has now agreed to the Tower’s demands
almost as a whole, saving only the brave Cappadocians. France has
already begun putting in place the necessary procedures to comply with
the treaty. Thus far, it’s only the harmless things — Healer’s Kits and
all that — but it won’t be too much longer before Safety Poles are set
up in Quiberon, Beauxbatons, Aix-en-Provence, and throughout Paris!
Brainwashing available at the touch of a finger!”

Reg lifted a finger in the air.

“One Thing stands in the way: our council. We’ve been fighting this
Atlantean nonsense for centuries, and we’re about to lose for good.
History will mark down this council as the one that failed… unless we
take a stand.

“I don’t know if you’ve ever noticed that, in an emergency, people in a
crowd are slow to help. Someone gets hit by a Quaffle and falls into the
stands, and everyone just stands back and looks shocked. No one in the
crowd feels responsible — they’re just watching. But when there’s only
one bystander, that person knows that it’s on them. They have to
intervene. And that’s us, now. That’s the Westphalian Council. We’ve
spent years fighting for the rights of nonhumans and Muggles! We sent
dozens to fight Grindelwald, and after Boston, we sent dozens to fight
Voldemort. We’re the only ally of the goblins that hasn’t already sold
their souls to this new Dark Lord.

“It’s us. We’re it. And if we fail, then that’s the end of everything.
Goblins in chains, Muggles start dying by the millions, and Westphalian
Council becomes one more footnote at the bottom of the page, reading,
‘Also destroyed in 1999 was the Westphalian Council, a once-important
American wizarding union.”

Limpel’s smirk had left her face, and she was solemn. “You’re right, of
course. Sorry.”

“No need for apologies, Limpel,” Reg said, shaking his head and leaning
back. “Just give me your word that you’re with me. The next Dark Lord
has risen, and we need to stop him. There is no one else… we are the
battle line, here in this council.”

She was nodding now, her mouth tight.

“So this isn’t a speech, Limpel, but a request,” he said, looking her
in the eye and speaking with the earnestness of an honest man. “Will you
help me stop Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, before he destroys the world as
we know it?”

********

“You smile too much, ‘Harry,’ “ Hermione Granger said to Nymphadora
Tonks, lightly. “For anyone who knows the real fellow, it’s a dead
giveaway. You should spend more time looking serious or thoughtful.
Alastor says that it’s important to put yourself in the right mood, and
so when he’s being Harry he just pretends everyone else in the room is a
child. He says Harry acts that way anyway, and it helps him be the right
kind of condescending.”

“Mad-Eye Moody says the meanest things I’ve ever heard *anyone* say
about someone that they love like a son,” Tonks said. She was running
her finger up and down the lightning-bolt scar on her forehead. “It
would be cute if it wasn’t exactly as creepy as everything else Mad-Eye
does.”

Hermione shrugged. “I think it’s sweet, really.”

She pushed through the swinging wooden door as they exited
Prestidigitation and Practicals. They were already being stared at, the
moment they stepped out into Diagon Alley but that was okay. That was
useful.

Hermione and Tonks-as-Harry made a beeline for the Safety Pole that had
been fixed in Diagon Alley nearly two years ago. Their pace slowed as
word spread. The Goddess was well-known and often out in public, but the
Tower rarely ever left Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. To
see him, you normally had to be either incredibly important or
incredibly ill.

Harry was essentially in prison, Hermione reflected, as she gingerly
moved through the crowd. He was trapped in his rooms at Hogwarts, forced
to send magical doppelgangers to major events. If an official envoy
insisted on meeting him in person, and that encounter seemed likely to
require Harry’s unique gifts, then that envoy simply had to come visit.
As it turned out, this was better for everyone, on all counts. Harry was
still not known for his social skills. There were other benefits, too.
For example, the arrangement made it impossible for anyone to pressure a
fake-Harry into an on-the-spot decision.

Ordinarily, Harry himself might have been the one to point out the
advantages of being forced to confer and consider on any major
decisions — of being pre-committed to that deliberation. It was right
out of Schelling’s *The Strategy of Conflict*, after all (page 30, her
mind automatically supplied).

But Harry couldn’t actually understand the whole concept, as she’d
discovered when she’d tried to talk to him about it. Once he’d gotten
important enough, he’d simply stopped wanting to leave the safety of
Hogwart’s. His Unbreakable Vow wouldn’t permit him to “take any chances”
with the destruction of the world, and at some point he had begun to
consider that there was a small chance his presence might be necessary
to save it. It was a very small chance, but it was a chance. He was too
unique, perhaps — the single point of failure in too many possible
systems. Hermione knew that this was why he did so much teaching. She
had never felt the same constraint, though, despite her similar Vow. Was
that humility on her part… or realism?

“Unbreakable Vows,” Harry had said, when she had tried to encourage him
to grapple with the situation, “are very effective. They don’t work like
genies in stories — I’m bound by the terms of the vow as it was meant, I
think, in a way that makes me do my best with it. So while I understand
what you’re saying in the abstract, I don’t *want* to want to leave
Hogwart’s or evade the Vow. Sorry.”

It was sad. He was his own jailer.

Automatically, Hermione was smiling radiantly and giving small nods to
people. At this point, basic public relations were on autopilot for her.
It was easy. Her beauty helped. Maturity would probably have evened out
her features anyway, but she also got a teensy-weensy bit of help from
the dark ritual that had infused her with the unearthly magnificence of
a unicorn. Plus, she’d been a world-renowned hero for several years now.
As the old adage (and Sunshine Army slogan) had it, “Practice makes
perfect.”

“Thank heavens for you,” a young woman said, reaching out to touch
Hermione’s arm. The woman looked to be something like thirty, but she
stood with self-conscious straightness. She was probably one of the
healed. Hermione nodded at her graciously, and eased by.

The prickling sensation in her arm began a moment later.

She glanced down, and saw a streak of something granular and colorless.
Hermione’s head whipped around, and she scanned for the young woman.
Gone in the crowd. The prickling had already become a burning, and she
even thought she could smell smoke. Some of the people nearby, already
pressing close (which is how this happened, she thought) were backing
away, their wands coming to hand and fear coming to their faces.

Hermione ripped the sleeve off of her robe, and scraped some of the
substance off her skin. As she did so, she heard Tonks-as-Harry casting
spells, waving her wand and calling, “*Protego Totalum! Evanesco! Cave
Inicum*!” But there didn’t seem to be any further immediate danger, and
now the surface of Hermione’s arm and robe were both burning with an
oily black smoke. Even scarier: it didn’t hurt that badly.

She plucked out her own wand, and spared a moment for the Fresh-Air
Charm; a mint-scented breeze ruffled up around her and swept away the
smoke. Keep the crowd safe. And she had to keep them safe from their own
panic. She knew she was just being silly, and that she was buying into
her own hype, and that wizards were essentially immune to crowd crushing
(there weren’t ever enough gathered in one place outside of a Quidditch
arena, first of all, and wizards were naturally tough), but she couldn’t
help herself: she hunched over her arm and raised her wand to her
throat. “*Sonorus*! Everyone, don’t worry!” Her amplified voice was
clear and strong, and accompanied by a reassuring smile. “Stay calm.”
*Your arm is burning, and you can’t really be seriously worried about
them. On the other hand, they don’t regenerate and we have an image to
maintain*.  ”Everything is all right.” *It’s a powder, not acid, and it
doesn’t smell like Faux Floo. Is this a distraction?* She glanced
around. Tonks was next to her, wand raised, glancing back and forth from
her to the crowd. The gathered wizards and witches were either frozen in
place or backing away, with a few taking a cue from her freshening charm
to put on Bubblehead Charms. No one was taking advantage of the
disturbance to attack.

Almost too late, she saw the black knapsack lying on the ground at her
feet.

“*Waddiwassi*!” The knapsack rocketed up into the air as Hermione cast
the spell on it. It was an incredibly easy and quick spell to cast, a
light tripping of syllables from the lips to the back of the mouth.
Twice as fast as *depulso* and eight times as fast as *wingardium
leviosa* — Hermione didn’t know why anyone would use anything else.

With a cracking boom that sounded much like a thunderbolt, the backpack
detonated.

Tonks-as-Harry turned to Hermione, even as the boom echoed around them
and people were screaming, and hissed one angry word. “Malfoy.”

********

Percy Weasley was maybe the best government employee imaginable, Harry
Potter-Evans-Verres thought to himself. He watched the young man
admiringly as Percy described the new accords reached within the
International Magical Trading Standards Body. One could always find
witches and wizards with the necessary competence and leadership, but it
was so rare to find someone with actual *perspective* — someone who knew
that unexciting things like standards for cauldron thickness really and
truly mattered, and that a three percent increase in the cauldron
failure rate meant thousands of Galleons in lost wealth (and perhaps
even actual loss of life, if some poor potion brewer couldn’t make it to
a Safety Pole).

These attributes are why Percy was effectively in charge of the
Ministry of Magic from his position as Senior Undersecretary to the
Minister for Magic. He didn’t think about outcomes in terms of
narratives or story. He thought about them in more absolute terms: so
many Galleons saved, people saved, options saved. Even better, Harry
thought, Percy was absolutely loyal.

“…moved more quickly,” the young man was saying, solemnly. “These
larger Vanishing Cabinets — we’re calling them Vanishing Rooms — do
present a serious security risk, though. And there’s a risk of
splinching, with such a volume, if anyone is inside when the shipment
goes through. You were absolutely right, though… we can move a thousand
times as much now. It actually brings up an interesting problem.
Apparently we’re shipping *out* more than we’re shipping *in*. It all
comes down to…”

Reflexively, Harry considered if his appreciation of Percy’s loyalty
was a Voldemort thought, tuning Percy’s report on trade deficits out of
mind for a moment. Was it wrong to consider personal loyalty to himself
as an inherently valuable trait in an ally? Perhaps it was, he thought.
It was not consistent with how he valued his other lieutenants. Amelia
or Mad-Eye would turn against him quickly if they thought he was corrupt
or evil, and that was good. While obstacles in general wouldn’t do him
much good, experience had often shown that he tended to underestimate
his own biases. Capable allies who could be relied upon to defy him, if
needed, were invaluable.

Harry went to work, mentally, picking apart the thought and turning the
instinct to his own use. In his youth, he had treated his mental
simulation of Voldemort (his “dark side,” he remembered with amusement)
as a closed programming loop that would accept input (”*This is my
problem*.”) and output an answer (”*Try killing everyone in your way,
maybe?*”). That answer would sometimes need to be rejected or modified
in the fact of contrary ethical guidelines, of course, but at its core,
he had treated the Voldemort thought-patterns as an opaque sort of
special reasoning.

That had been silly, and the huge disadvantages had become obvious
after a year spent clumsily clomping around the intricate plans of two
geniuses. He had acted with the absolute self-assurance and total
obliviousness of a first-year psychology student, and it was only thanks
to the advantage of actually *knowing the future* that one of those
geniuses had managed to succeed in saving the world (almost despite
Harry’s best ignorant efforts).

So, he had spent some time integrating the Voldemort simulation into
his own psyche, and now routinely examined his thinking to critically
assess his success. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, after all, and he
would have been a fool to ignore Amelia’s concerns (”Young man, if there
is a Voldemort in your head, then you can either crush it into
submission or we can carve it out. The choice is yours.”) Harry glanced
down at the ring on his finger, an unadorned metal band.

Harry returned his full attention to Percy, hoping nothing important
had been said in the meantime and feeling a little shabby about having
let his thoughts wander. Fortunately, much of the report had been for
the benefit of others. Harry had already studied sufficient economics,
but much of his council was still learning the essentials. The education
was necessary, since economics were a weapon and a tool of state.

“…so this is actually to our advantage, and we may be able to use it
as leverage.” Percy concluded. He glanced around the room for questions,
then settled his rawboned frame back into his chair. He was a striking
young man, tall and thin with the vivid red Weasley hair and freckles.
He had once been balding and bespectacled, but Harry had taken care of
that.

“Thank you,” Harry said, smiling. “It’s always good to have another
tool to use, should we need it.” Truth be told, it probably was never
going to be useful. It was hard to even say that a trade deficit was a
bad thing for anyone involved, and that was especially true with an
economy nearly decoupled from labor. But it might be a propaganda point,
to be brought up in a negotiation or something.

“Now let us turn to the next item on the agenda,” he said, glancing
down at the parchment. “Amelia, you had Ms. Bogdanov and Ms. Covenant
meet with their respective Muggle equivalents in the Medicines and
Health Products Regulatory Agency? How did that go?” Ilya Bogdanov and
Tilly Covenant were in charge of the Office for the Detection and
Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects.

“Not very well, Harry,” Amelia Bones said, rising from her seat in
turn. She was a plain-looking young woman, with a square jaw and
chestnut hair pulled back into a tight bun. She looked (unsurprisingly)
much like Susan Bones, her niece. “Bogdanov didn’t give it a chance, and
came to me to tell me that it was, and I quote, ‘a tragic mistake to
think that Muggles should be in charge of any part of the Department of
Magical Law Enforcement.’ She specifically mentioned that the Muggles
had proposed that anyone who tests magical devices should be blinded.”
Amelia leaned forward and glared at Harry. “I told you that this would
happen, Harry.”

Harry sighed. He’d thought they were further along than this. “The
Muggles didn’t mean that the testers should be literally blind. A blind
study is ju-”

“A blind study is a study where the examiners keep themselves ignorant
of the origin of what they’re measuring, yes I know,” Amelia
interrupted, curtly. “You know that and *I know that* but these witches
weren’t looking for knowledge. They were just looking for an excuse not
to change their minds.”

“Yes… ‘most people would rather die than think, and many do.’” Harry
quoted. “But Amelia, we can’t just fire the heads of every office, just
because they’re not working with us as smoothly as we’d like.”. They’d
had this argument before. Harry thought it was better to have the dozens
of recalcitrant officials dragging their heels on the inside, rather
than agitating on the outside. All the real troublemakers might have
been decapitated in a single night, long ago, but that didn’t mean it
would be a good idea to give some of wizarding Britain’s most prominent
witches and wizards a direct reason to oppose the new regime. Amelia
would have none of it, though.

“We don’t have to fire them all. But we fired Shacklebolt, to make an
example, and it wasn’t enough. How about we just demote some of this
dead weight, instead.”

“And get around the Peter Principle? Hm.” Harry paused for a moment.
“You have a point there, actually. Table this now, maybe, and we’ll work
out the possibilities?”

Amelia nodded, just as the door burst open. Hermione and Tonks strode
into the meeting room, clothes still damp from rapidly evaporating
Thieves’ Downfall. Tonks looked furious, and as her hair lengthened into
her typical shoulder-length, multicolored long locks, it framed a iron
scowl. Something had gone wrong, it would seem.

Like all rooms in the Tower, the meeting room was an uneven quadrangle.
It was an odd side-effect of the most important aspect of their security
protocol, which required the entire Tower complex to be shaped as one
giant triangle. It was strange, but it did mean that entrances could be
particularly dramatic, which was useful for negotiations. The very shape
of the room pointed everyone’s attention at the narrow wall, where the
open door framed an irritated Hermione Granger.

***********

 “Hello, everyone. Sorry for the rude entrance,” she said. She glanced
around at the group, which collectively represented most of the power of
magical Britain, not to mention the greater part of Europe. Her eye
paused for a second on Charlevoix, one of her Returned and a witch who
had been instrumental in the recent French agreement. The excitable
woman was almost out of her seat in alarm, scarred hands clenched on her
chair. Hermione’s glance communicated peace, and Charlevoix’s face
softened. Hermione turned to Harry, who had risen and was waiting
patiently for her to speak.

“Harry,” she said. “Malfoy just blew up a bomb in the middle of Diagon
Alley. No one was hurt, but dozens could have been injured or killed. I
know you have a plan, but that couldn’t have been part of it. What is
going on?”

She watched as he absorbed this information. Harry looked slightly
surprised for a moment, and then his mouth pursed, and then his face
relaxed.

“A Muggle device that casts *Deprimo*,” murmured Percy Weasley to the
rest of the table. Amelia Bones already seemed to know, as did a few
others (like the Muggle Liaison), but most had seemed uncomprehending.
There was quiet murmuring in response.

“Was any property destroyed?” Harry asked, seriously.

“No,” she said.

“Thanks to Hermione,” Tonks said indignantly, from her spot behind the
Goddess.

“No one was hurt and no property destroyed… was it a very small bomb?
No, you took care of it. Did you put it into a pouch with an
Undetectable Extension Charm, or something?” He looked thoughtful.

She shook her head. “No. Wait, would that even work?”

They both paused for a second to consider it, but he was the first to
shake his head. “Not really, I don’t think… although it might contain
the blast and direct its force out of the opening of the pouch.” He made
a note on the margin of the parchment in front of him — an agenda to
their meeting, she thought. “We should look into that.”

“Especially now that Malfoy’s started using bombs,” Hermione said,
archly. “Harry, you look like you understand what’s going on, and that
you’re not worried. That makes me worried. This is a new level, and it
could have killed a lot of people. But you don’t seem to be taking it
seriously. Just what is going on?”

Harry shook his head, reaching up to tuck a lock of his hair back
behind his ear. She had noticed that he usually tied it back these days,
but he’d left it loose this morning. Also, he was wearing Muggle
clothes — a three-piece grey suit, with a blue silk tie. It looked
rather well on his short and spare frame, but he tended to favor
wizard’s robes, these days. Were these subtle signs of distress at his
imprisonment? Maybe he — or his subconscious — was feeling the effects
of the long confinement. She set the thought aside for later
consideration.

“We’re at war, Hermione. You know that.” At least Harry no longer
looked so sure of himself, although it was probably only because he was
worried about her. “They’re going to keep ramping things up until they
get a reaction, or until we capitulate on something.”

Cedric Diggory spoke up from the end of the table, his voice kind but
firm. “And that doesn’t worry you, Harry?” The young Chief Auror looked
skeptical.

“There’s a plan. We’re on track — two new Unspeakables arrived with
reports just today, and there are new breakthroughs.” Harry looked
around the room. No one looked reassured. “I know I’ve been saying that
for a long time-”

“For years,” Tonks interrupted. She sounded frustrated.

“—I’ve been saying that for years, yes.” Harry smoothly continued. “But
you have to trust me on this. We can beat Malfoy and the whole faction…
it will happen.” His eyes moved from face to face, asking their trust.
“There’s a plan. It has been extremely complicated and unbelievably
secret, but very soon now we will beat Narcissa, once and for all.”

********

 Sometime later, a young man with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead
sat down with a sigh on a small wooden stool. He was alone, and this
room was private, admissible only to him. He could slump wearily without
worrying about his posture. No one could see.

In front of him, on another wooden stool identical to his own, was a
small black box. It was smooth and shiny, marred only by the pair of
small hinges and the ornate lock that held its lid on. He stared at the
box sightlessly for a while as he thought, letting his eyes glaze over
and his mind wander.

Harry sat like that for a long time. Eventually, he blinked rapidly and
returned to himself. He spoke to the box, quietly.

“I’d like to talk. But I won’t let you out.”
